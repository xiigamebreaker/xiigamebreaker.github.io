        <h1>Welcome to All about Me</h1>

        <img id="its-me" src="images/ItsMe.jpg" alt="Me on my Triumph" width="300">
        <p>Hello, I'm Noah Amman, and I'm excited to share my story with you. Born in Springfield, Missouri, and
            raised
            in
            Ozark&#44; I now live back in Springfield. As an electrician, I've gained valuable hands-on experience,
            but
            I'm
            ready to start a new chapter. That's why I've decided to pursue a degree in computer science.</p>
        <p>I have a wide range of interests, including gaming, binge-watching TV shows and movies, and riding my
            motorcycle.
            Gaming not only provides a perfect escape for relaxation but also sparks my creativity and love for
            immersive
            fantasy worlds. Riding my motorcycle is another way I get my adrenaline and enjoy speed. I'm also a big
            fan
            of
            Marvel &amp; DC content, as well as a variety of anime.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, my goals include earning a degree in computer science and starting a family. I am
            especially
            excited about the chance to learn how to build a website in this course and use it to build my dad's
            business a website. I can't wait to gain new knowledge this semester, and I'm eager to apply what I
            learn to
            reach my goals.</p>
